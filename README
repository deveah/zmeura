    Zmeura ~ another lua roguelike
    (c) 2015, Vlad Dumitru. See LICENCE for details.
    --

    Zmeura is an open-world, coffeebreak roguelike written using the mazga
    (http://github.com/deveah/mazga) minimal roguelike framework.

    Right now you can wander around a small-ish map and destroy trees.

    How to compile
    --

    Building requires development headers for Lua (preferably 5.2) and some
    flavour of curses.

    To build the game,
    $ make
    
    And then to run,
    $ ./zmeura
