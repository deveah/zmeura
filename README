	Mazga
	a barebones lua roguelike framework
	--

	Mazga is a a base for lua roguelikes, containing only a wrapper for the
	most basic of curses functions. It serves as a starting point for any
	future projects I may need something alike.

	The framework can be built using either Lua >=5.2, or LuaJIT >=2.0.2.
	Use the provided Makefile in order to build both modes, but be wary that
	you may need to alter the libs in each case.

	Build with Lua 5.2:
	$ make lua52

	Build with LuaJIT:
	$ make luajit

	All curses-related functions belong inside the 'curses' global table,
	and are as following:

	*	init() - initializes the window, returning its width and height; you
		may need to alter the initialization procedures it calls
	*	terminate() - closes the window
	*	write( x, y, string ) - writes the provided string at the provided
		coordinates; be wary that the coordinates start from 0, not 1.
	*	getch() - waits for a keypress, and then returns it; the function
		may return a specific string for non-printable characters
	*	attr( a ) - sets the current attributes; see below
	*	clear()
	*	refresh()
	*	move( x, y ) - positions the cursor at the specified position
	*	cursor( c ) - toggles the state of the cursor; see curs_set of the
		curses manual for a more detailed explanation
	*	getstr() - returns a string provided from the keyboard; when the
		string is input, echoing is toggled on; before returning the string,
		it toggles the echoing off again

	Attributes are as following:
	*	colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
	*	bold
	*	inverse
	*	normal

	In any case, please read the source code before using, since it contains
	behaviour (very) specific to my needs related to roguelike development.
